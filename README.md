# Platos-Pizza-Annual-Sales-Report
This visualization file showcases the annual performance
This is my entry into the Maven Analytics Pizza Challenge. The goal was to analyze a fictious pizza place called Plato's pizza.

For this challenge, my task was to build a single-page dashboard based on fictious owner (Mario's) email to help him improve the restaurant's operations.

Here were Mario's questions that were needed to be answered:

What days and times do we tend to be busiest?

How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?

What are our best and worst selling pizzas?

What's our average order value?

How well are we utilizing our seating capacity? (we have 15 tables and 60 seats)

Preparation: 

The data was provided by Maven as a part of the challenge.

It was contained in 4 .csv files, named Orders, Order Details, Pizzas, and Pizza type (can be found in the dataset section).

I opened the .csv files in Google Sheets to inspect them

Process : Data Cleaning, Modeling, DAX, Enhance UI, Power View Reports and Row Level Security
